# what works

- connecting/disconnecting
- bottom menu controls
  - north, south, east, west, scan, look, exits

# what doesn't work so well

- focus is sometimes lost on the input box
- colours

# Todo

- allow Lua scripts for input aliases and incoming text
- allow extensions for the bottom menu
  - so users can add functions 
  - maybe configurable amount of input buttons per row
- fix colours
- in app editing of the scripts
